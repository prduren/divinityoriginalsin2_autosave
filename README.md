Autosaves Divinity: Original Sin 2 every 4 minutes! Because you will inevitably forget, and pay the price. 

- Download AutoHotKey and run the .ahk file when you're in-game! This script can be built on to a tiny bit to specify the active window (the game) so that F5 isn't

 when you're done playing.
